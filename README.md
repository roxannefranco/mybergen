A travel guide Blog for the city of Bergen, Norway - created as my 1st year Exam Project for Front-end Development course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## Description

MyBergen is a travel guide Blog with a Headless WordPress installation to manage the website's posts.

- 10 posts on the List of Posts page with a button to show load more posts;
- modal images on specific Posts pages;
- each page with a title that matches the specific post the user is on;
- a form on Contact page with Javascript validation;
- catch of errors and success message on the Contact form;
- a fully responsive project on all screen sizes.
